HerochatBungeeBridge-Bukkit
===========================

Cross server Herochat for BungeeCord - Bukkit plugin.

I use Maven so you can compile with that. I couldn't find a Maven repository for Herochat so if you're using Eclipse just add the .jar to your build path and you should be good. I used Herochat version 5.6.7.

Made by: KoolKrafer of spigotmc.org with some config modifications.

Will need to re-generate your config, this goes on the SERVER NOT the Bungee server!
